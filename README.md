The hlmer package is a companion to the lme4 and lmerTest packages that automates the formulation of mixed-effects linear equations from user-supplied model characteristics. Output of the hlmer() function is meant to approximate the output of the HLM7 program by Raudenbush, Bryk, and Congdon (2014; Scientific Software International, Inc.) by supplementing lmer() output with statistics such as reliability estimates for random effects, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and chi-square tests for random-effect variance.
